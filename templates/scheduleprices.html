            <h3>Schedule</h3>
            <p>
              Advanced students are welcome to attend lower-level classes. Students should not attend classes above their rank without prior approval from Sean. The classes will be taught according to the ranks described below, so it is important to attend the classes for your level as much as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              The classes are held at St. Andrew's Community Center, 3380 Barnstead Lane, Halifax. We use the multipurpose room at the back of the building when entering through the main doors. Note that Barnstead Lane is only accessible from Bayers Road outbound by car.<br><br>

            <h3>Class Fees</h3>

              <li>Option 2) $45.00/month (tax incl.) for any/all of the above classes for 3 months or more, or for multiple family members. </li>
